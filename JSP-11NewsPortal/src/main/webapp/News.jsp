	<p>Israel was caught napping. Not for the first time, Israel has perhaps become a victim of its own success, and the hubris and complacency engendered by its success in combating terrorism. The ability of the Palestinian para-state terrorist group Hamas to breach Israel’s formidable defences was as much a function of a complete systemic failure of Israel’s security as it was the success of Hamas’s audacity and innovative ‘shock and awe’ tactics -- something that other countries fighting terrorism need to start factoring in.</p>
